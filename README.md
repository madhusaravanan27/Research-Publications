- **Description**: Developed hybrid convolutional neural network (CNN) models (FCN, U-Net, res-FCN) and NARX for segmenting and detecting white matter damage in cranial ultrasound images of preterm infants. Implemented preprocessing (multi-thresholding, Canny edge detection, MSER feature extraction), K-means clustering, and Bayesian regularization using MATLAB, achieving high-precision detection of neurodevelopmental deficits.
- **Relevance**: Demonstrates expertise in deep learning, medical imaging, data preprocessing, and visualization, applicable to Data Scientist and Software Engineer roles in healthcare AI and autonomous systems.
