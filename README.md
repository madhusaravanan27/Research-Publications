- **Description**: Developed hybrid convolutional neural network (CNN) models (FCN, U-Net, res-FCN) and NARX for segmenting white matter damage in cranial ultrasound images of preterm infants, improving detection of neurodevelopmental deficits. Implemented preprocessing (Canny edge detection, MSER feature extraction) and analysis (K-means clustering, Bayesian regularization) using MATLAB.
